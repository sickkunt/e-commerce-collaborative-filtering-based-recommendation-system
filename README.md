This project focuses on building a robust e-commerce recommendation system that leverages three distinct collaborative filtering techniques: user-based , item-based , and deep learning-based approaches. The primary goal is to enhance the user experience by providing personalized product recommendations, thereby increasing user engagement, improving conversion rates, and fostering customer satisfaction.

The system uses a preprocessed dataset of user-product interactions, which includes four key attributes: UserId, ProductId, Rating, and Timestamp. These interactions are used to construct a user-item matrix , which serves as the foundation for all recommendation methods. The project addresses common challenges in recommendation systems, such as data sparsity , scalability , and the cold start problem , while ensuring computational efficiency and interpretability.

Key Features of the Project
User-Based Collaborative Filtering :
This approach identifies users with similar preferences by calculating cosine similarity between users based on their rating patterns. Recommendations are generated by predicting ratings for unrated items using a weighted average of ratings from similar users. This method is intuitive and interpretable but may struggle with scalability as the number of users grows.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering :
This technique focuses on relationships between products rather than users. By calculating item-item similarity , the system recommends products that are often rated similarly by users. For example, if many users who purchased Product A also purchased Product B, the system suggests Product B to users who have purchased Product A. This method is computationally efficient and works well for dense datasets.
Deep Learning-Based Collaborative Filtering :
The deep learning model introduces latent factor representations and neural networks to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions. The architecture includes embedding layers for users and items, concatenated and passed through dense layers to predict ratings. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods by modeling non-linear relationships and providing more nuanced recommendations. The model is trained using normalized ratings (scaled to [0, 1]) and optimized to minimize prediction errors.
Scalability and Efficiency :
To handle large datasets efficiently, the system employs techniques such as batch processing for predictions and fallback mechanisms for missing data. Additionally, mappings between user/product IDs and numerical indices ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
